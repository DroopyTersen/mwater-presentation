			<p>Hi, thanks for taking the time to check this out.</p>

				<p>This opportunity is VERY enticing.</p>
				<p>I've never had the opportunity to work for such a worthy cause, and I couldn't have requested a more exciting technology stack.</p>

				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>I am a web developer. I work for <a href='http://skylinetechnologies.com/'>Skyline Technologies</a>, a consulting company, out of their Milwaukee office.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Microsoft Shop</h3>
				<p>Skyline is a Microsoft Gold Partner, so at work I am primarily in the Microsoft stack.  Primarily Asp.Net MVC and SharePoint.</p>
				<p>That being said, web is web.  I love that client-side skills are technology agnostic.</p>

				<h3>Coding For Fun</h3>
				<p>I spend a large amount of my free time coding for fun.  About 6 months ago I jumped on the nodejs bandwagon and haven't looked back</p>
				<p>Everything I do now is with Node and Mongo.</p>
